            <h2>ROHIT SHARMA</h2>
            <p>Languid and easy on the eye, Rohit Sharma owned all the shots in the book when he emerged from the Mumbai suburbs as heir apparent to the Indian batting greats of the 2000s. It took him time and persistence, but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20.

That Rohit had talent was apparent to both the casual observer and to the trained eye. Fans were frustrated at the long wait for the potential to translate into runs, though selectors and captains, knowing better, kept backing him. At one point the word "talent" was Rohit's bugbear, a pejorative nickname for him on social media. Once it all clicked, though - the move to open the batting in ODIs late in 2012 was one particular turning point - things came together spectacularly.

Rohit scored ODI double-hundreds for fun, won six IPLs in the first 15 editions of the tournament, scored five hundreds at the 2019 ODI World Cup, and when he finally got to open in Tests in 2019, three quick hundreds in his first series in the role, one of them a double.</p>

            <h2>Rohit Sharma IPL factfile</h2>
            <p>- Rohit Sharma has won six IPL titles: one with Deccan Chargers and five as captain of Mumbai Indians (MI), making him the joint most successful captain in the Indian Premier League.

- He joined Mumbai in 2011 and became captain in 2013. He took them to their maiden IPL title in his first season as captain and went on to lead MI for 11 years before he was replaced by Hardik Pandya for the 2024 season.

- Rohit is MI's top-scorer and one of only four batters with more than 6000 runs in the IPL. He has two hundreds in the IPL so far - one was in 2012 and the other in 2024.

- Rohit's best IPL season with the bat was in 2013, when he scored 538 runs in MI's title-winning campaign. In 2015, Rohit was the Player of the Final as Mumbai beat Chennai Super Kings to win their second IPL title. MI went on to win the IPL in 2017, 2019 and 2020 under Rohit's leadership</p>
